    <h1>ARIA: Accessible Rich Internet Applications</h1>

    <!-- 
        What is ARIA?
        ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. 
        It is a set of attributes that you can add to HTML elements to make web content and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities.
        Specifically, ARIA helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the roles, states, and properties of user interface elements that are not natively supported by HTML.

      <h2>The First Rule of ARIA</h2>
      <!-- 
            The first rule of ARIA is: "Don't use ARIA." 
            This means if you can use a native HTML element (like <button>, <input>, <nav>, etc.) that already has the built-in semantics and keyboard support, use that instead of re-creating it with ARIA. 
            Only use ARIA when native HTML elements cannot achieve the desired functionality or accessibility.
        -->
      <p>
        If you can use a native HTML element or attribute with the semantics and
        behavior you require, then do so instead of repurposing an element and
        adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible.

      <h2>Key Concepts of ARIA</h2>

      <h3>1. Roles</h3>
      <!-- 
            Roles define *what* an element is or does. 
            They override the element's native role. 
            Example: role="button", role="navigation", role="alert".
        -->
      <div role="button" tabindex="0">
        Click Me (This is a div acting as a button)
      </div>
      <!-- Note: When using role="button" on a non-interactive element like div, you MUST also add tabindex="0" to make it focusable and handle keyboard events (Enter/Space) with JavaScript. -->

      <h3>2. Properties</h3>
      <!-- 
            Properties define characteristics of an element that are less likely to change.
            Example: aria-label, aria-labelledby, aria-describedby, aria-required.
        -->
      <br />
      <label for="username">Username:</label>
      <input
        type="text"
        id="username"
        aria-required="true"
        aria-describedby="username-desc"
      />
      <span id="username-desc">Your unique username for login.</span>

      <h3>3. States</h3>
      <!-- 
            States define the current condition of an element, which *can* change due to user interaction.
            Example: aria-checked, aria-disabled, aria-expanded, aria-hidden.
        -->
      <br /><br />
      <button
        aria-expanded="false"
        onclick="
          this.setAttribute(
            'aria-expanded',
            this.getAttribute('aria-expanded') === 'false' ? 'true' : 'false',
          )
        "
      >
        Toggle Menu
      </button>

      <h2>Common ARIA Attributes</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>aria-label:</strong> Defines a string value that labels an
          interactive element. Use this when there is no visible text on screen
          (like an icon button).
          <br />
          <button aria-label="Close">X</button>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>aria-labelledby:</strong> Identifies the element (or elements)
          that labels the current element. It references the ID of another
          element.
          <br />
          <h3 id="billing-info">Billing Information</h3>
          <div role="region" aria-labelledby="billing-info">...content...</div>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>aria-hidden:</strong> Indicates whether an element is exposed
          to the accessibility API. `aria-hidden="true"` hides the element from
          screen readers but keeps it visible visually.
          <br />
          <span aria-hidden="true">Thinking... (Icon)</span>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>aria-live:</strong> Indicates that an element will be updated,
          and describes the types of updates the user agents, assistive
          technologies, and user can expect from the live region.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>aria-live="polite"</code>: Wait until the user is idle to
              announce updates.
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>aria-live="assertive"</code>: Interrupt the user to announce
              updates immediately.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div role="alert" aria-live="assertive">Error: Invalid password.</div>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Accessibility Tree</h2>
      <!-- 
            The browser takes the DOM (Document Object Model) and creates an "Accessibility Tree". 
            Assistive technologies (like screen readers) interact with this Accessibility Tree, not the visual UI.
            ARIA modifies this tree without changing the visual appearance or behavior of the elements.
        -->
      <p>
        ARIA attributes modify the accessibility tree, providing extra context
        to assistive technologies.
