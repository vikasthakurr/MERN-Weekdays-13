      JavaScript Notes: History, Evolution, and Execution
      ---------------------------------------------------

      1) History (Short Timeline)
      - 1995: JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in about 10 days.
      - First name: Mocha, then LiveScript, then JavaScript.
      - 1997: Standardized as ECMAScript (ES) by ECMA International.
      - ES5 (2009): Major stable features for modern web apps.
      - ES6 / ES2015 (2015): let, const, classes, arrow functions, modules, promises.
      - After 2015: New versions released yearly (ES2016, ES2017, ...).

      2) Why JavaScript Became Popular
      - Runs directly in browsers.
      - Makes web pages interactive (buttons, forms, dynamic UI).
      - Same language can run on server with Node.js.
      - Huge ecosystem and community support.

      3) How JavaScript Runs in Browser
      - Browser has a JavaScript Engine (for example: V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox).
      - Engine reads JS code and executes it.
      - Browser also provides Web APIs (DOM, setTimeout, fetch, localStorage, etc.).
      - JS uses:
        - Call Stack: runs function execution in order.
        - Web APIs: handles async tasks outside main JS thread.
        - Callback Queue / Microtask Queue: stores completed async callbacks.
        - Event Loop: moves ready callbacks to call stack when stack is empty.

      4) JavaScript Engine Basics
      - Parsing: code -> Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
      - Compilation/Optimization: engine prepares code for execution.
      - Execution: runs instructions and manages memory.
      - Garbage Collector: removes unused memory automatically.

      5) What is JIT (Just-In-Time Compilation)?
      - JIT means the engine compiles code during runtime (while program is running).
      - Fast path:
        1. Start with baseline compilation/interpreter.
        2. Detect frequently used ("hot") code.
        3. Optimize hot code with JIT compiler.
      - Benefit: better performance than pure interpretation.
      - If assumptions fail, engine can de-optimize and recompile.

      6) JavaScript Nature
      - Single-threaded language (one main call stack for JS code).
      - Non-blocking behavior is achieved using async APIs + event loop.
      - Dynamically typed (variable type can change at runtime).

      7) Browser vs Node.js
      - Browser JS:
        - Has DOM and browser APIs.
        - Used for frontend UI.
      - Node.js:
        - Uses V8 engine outside browser.
        - Has server-side APIs (fs, http, process, etc.).
        - DOM is not available by default.

      8) Script Loading
      - <script src="..."> blocks HTML parsing until file is downloaded and executed.
      - Use `defer` to load script in parallel and execute after HTML parsing.
      - Use `async` for independent scripts where order is not important.
