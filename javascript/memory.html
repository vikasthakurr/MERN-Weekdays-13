      JavaScript Memory Notes - Student Friendly
      ------------------------------------------

      1) What is Memory in JavaScript?
      - Memory is used to store variables, objects, arrays, and functions while code runs.

      2) Stack vs Heap (quick recall)
      - Stack: stores primitive values and function call frames.
      - Heap: stores objects/arrays/functions (reference types).
      - Variables for reference types hold a reference (address), not full data.

      3) Garbage Collection (GC)
      - JavaScript automatically frees memory that is no longer reachable.
      - If something is still referenced, GC will not remove it.

      4) What is a Memory Leak?
      - Memory leak means memory keeps growing because references are not released.
      - Common causes:
        - Unstopped intervals/timeouts
        - Unremoved event listeners
        - Large arrays/objects kept forever
        - Closures that retain unused data

      5) About this Demo
      - "Start Leak" starts an interval and keeps pushing large arrays into `leakyArray`.
      - This continuously increases memory usage.
      - "Stop Leak" only stops adding new data.
      - Already stored data still remains in memory because `leakyArray` still references it.

      6) How to Fix Fully
      - Stop the interval.
      - Clear references, for example: `leakyArray = []`.
      - Remove listeners when they are no longer needed.
